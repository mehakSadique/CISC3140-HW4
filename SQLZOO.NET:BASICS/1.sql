/*The example uses a WHERE clause to show the population of 'France'. Note that strings (pieces of text that are data) should be in 'single quotes';

Modify it to show the population of Germany Changing the name to Germany will give the correct answer*/


SELECT population FROM world
  WHERE name = 'Germany'
